# Cocos2D-X

Cocos2D-X added BlackBerry PlayBook support back in [Mid-January 2012](http://openbbnews.wordpress.com/2012/01/20/cocos2d-x-upstream/)
in cocos2d-1.0.1-x [0.11.0](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/news/44).
Since then BlackBerry PlayBook has been fully supported, with bug fixes and improvements added in each release - check out the details of
[0.12.0](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/news/48) and
[0.13.0 beta](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/news/51).

Since this repository is no longer useful and is causing some confusions, we are removing the sources.

If you are interested in using Cocos2D-X on the PlayBook, go download it directly from [cocos2d-x.org](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/)
